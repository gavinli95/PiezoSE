# PiezoSE
This PiezoSE is implemented based on MP-SENet:A Speech Enhancement Model with Parallel Denoising of Magnitude and Phase Spectra, the original GitHub link is https://github.com/yxlu-0102/MP-SENet. PiezoSE utilizes piezoelectric signal and audio signal to implement real-time speech enhancement with self-designed piezo-embedded earbuds.
